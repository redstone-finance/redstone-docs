# Introduction

![Banner](/img/redstone-banner.png)


RedStone is an Oracle that delivers frequently updated, reliable, and diverse data feeds for your dApp and smart contracts on multiple L1s & L2s.

### Why we build another Oracle system

- Pushing data on-chain regardless of wheter it is used or not is a huge waste of resources
- Obsolete and monolithic architecture limits scalability (it's hard to list new assets or reduce latency)
- Protocols cannot fully decide on trusted sources and data update conditions
- End-users are fully dependent on relayers and could be cut off from the service

### Solution

RedStone offers a radically different design of Oracles catering to the needs of modern DeFi protocols.

- Data providers can avoid the requirement of continuous on-chain data delivery
- Allow end users to self-deliver signed Oracle data on-chain
- Use the decentralized Streamr network to deliver signed oracle data to the end users
- Use token incentives to motivate data providers to maintain data integrity and uninterrupted service
- Leverage the Arweave blockchain as cheap and permanent storage for archiving Oracle data and maintaining data providers' accountability

## Key facts

- The [modular architecture](./smart-contract-devs/how-it-works.md#data-flow) maintains [data integrity](./smart-contract-devs/how-it-works.md#data-format) from source to smart contracts
- There are [3 different ways](./smart-contract-devs/how-it-works.md#3-ways-to-integrate) to integrate our service tailored to your needs
- We provide feeds for more than [1000 assets](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/tokens) integrating [~50 data sources](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/sources)
- We are present on [20+ chains](https://showroom.redstone.finance/) 
- RedStone has been live on mainnets since March 2022 with no downtime. Code was audited by ABDK, Packshield and L2Beat Co-Founder.
- RedStone was a launch partner for [DeltaPrime](https://deltaprime.io/) on Avalanche and delivered data feeds not available anywhere else. Thanks to that DeltaPrime became the top 3 fastest growing dApps according to DefiLama.

<!-- ## Building blocks

The RedStone ecosystem could be divided into 3 main areas:

- **Data provision** is responsible for fetching the data from external sources, transforming it into a common format, signing it, and broadcasting the collected information.
  - Implemented as → [RedStone Oracle Node](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/tree/main/packages/oracle-node)

- **Data access** is responsible for serving data to end users by various means, such as a web portal, an HTTP API, on-chain feeds, or third-party applications.

  - Web portal → [RedStone App](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-app)
  - HTTP API → [RedStone Api](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-api)
  - EVM connector → [RedStone EVM connector](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/tree/main/packages/evm-connector)

- **Data integrity** is responsible for enforcing high quality of data by incentivizing providers with tokens for keeping their service and punishing them for outages and misrepresented data.
  - Concept → [Argue protocol](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/oracle-node/docs/DISPUTE_RESOLUTION.md)
  - Implementation → [RedStone eth contracts](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/tree/main/packages/eth-contracts) -->
