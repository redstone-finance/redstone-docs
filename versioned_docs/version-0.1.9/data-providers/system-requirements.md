# System Requirements

The hardware requirements for running a RedStone node are incredibly low. Obviously, the more resources you spare when provisioning your machine, the better it will perform and the less likely it will be to run into issues.

### Recommended system configuration

- 1GB of RAM
- Reliable access to the Internet
- At least 30 GB of storage (mainly for logs data)
