# ⛓ Supported Chains

RedStone oracles are cross-chain by definition, so you can use them on any chain. But for EVM compatible chains the integration will go smoother thanks to the prepared tooling.

You can check the integration with few of supported chains in the [RedStone Showroom App.](https://showroom.redstone.finance/)

### The following EVM chains are supported

- Ethereum
- Avalanche
- Polygon
- Celo
- BNB
- Optimism
- Arbitrum
- Fantom
- Stacks

- Kava
- Gnosis
- RSK
- Klaytn
- Cronos
- Elrond
- Metis

### We also support few non-EVM-compatible chains

- [Near](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-near-connectors)

:::important Other chains
Potentially you can use it on any other chain but it would require some custom development.
You can write your own implementation for the blockchain of your choice. Feel free to contact us [on discord](https://redstone.finance/discord) for details.
