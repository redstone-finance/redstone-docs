# Canton

The RedStone Pull model integrates naturally with the Canton network’s architecture, enabling dApps to access fresh,
verifiable data without introducing persistent on-ledger storage.

Canton differs from traditional EVMs by not exposing a global public state.
Each participant node sees only the contracts and data it is involved in,
while a synchronizer orders transactions without accessing their contents.
This architecture aligns naturally with RedStone’s Pull model:
since oracle data is supplied directly within a transaction rather than published on-chain,
the data remains visible only to the parties executing it.
The synchronizer simply routes the payload without learning anything about it,
making RedStone oracle updates fully compatible with Canton’s privacy-by-design ledger model.

## Data flow in the RedStone Pull model on Canton

1. When an application initiates a transaction, it first retrieves the latest RedStone data off-chain using RedStone’s Data Distribution Layer.
2. The client (backend or frontend) fetches a signed payload consisting of RedStone data packages, containing prices or other oracle values.
3. This signed payload is embedded directly into the transaction sent to Canton.
4. Upon arrival at the relevant participant nodes, the Daml smart contract logic verifies the signatures, timestamps, and data integrity.
5. If the data is valid, the transaction executes using the provided oracle values.
6. Because the oracle data exists only inside this transaction, it creates no persistent contract state change
and is visible only to the parties involved, fully matching Canton’s selective-disclosure privacy model.

## RedStone SDK module — [details](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/canton-connector/daml/sdk/README.md)

Provides the primitives for processing RedStone messages and validating them on Canton, including signature checks,
timestamp verification, and data-package decoding that application contracts use to safely consume oracle values.

## Core module — [details](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/canton-connector/daml/core/README.md)

Contains an example Daml contract that encapsulates the price-extraction logic using the SDK, demonstrating
how to integrate RedStone validation into real business logic and how templates can obtain verified oracle prices.
