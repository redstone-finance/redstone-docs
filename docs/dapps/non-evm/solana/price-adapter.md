# RedStone Solana Price Adapter

- The [PriceAdapter](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/tree/main/packages/solana-connector/deployments/solanaMultiFeed/programs/redstone-solana-price-adapter/README.md) contract is updated from one or more off-chain processes.
- The data is written to a [`PriceData`](./price-feed-account.md#structure) structure in an account created per each Feed id
- The contract can be read by one of `view` functions.
- The parameters`/logic update requires changing the code.
  - Still, **the [Price Feed Account Address](./price-feed-account.md#deriving-account-addresses) remains unchanged**
    and is readable forever.
- The IDL files are available in the [monorepo directory](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/tree/main/packages/solana-connector/src/_autogenerated).
  - The address field there is empty — use the deployed one.
