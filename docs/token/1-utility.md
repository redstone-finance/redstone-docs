# Staking For Economic Security

:::warning
RED is not live yet
:::

For oracles to survive and secure DeFi long-term, sustainable tokenomics are essential.

RED is designed as a utility token with an innovative value accrual mechanism, introducing the first truly sustainable oracle economics.

Leveraging RedStone's EigenLayer Actively Validated Service (AVS), RED staking adds a robust layer of economic security to RedStone's oracle stack, utilizing staked RED and potentially tapping into billions of dollars staked in EigenLayer for additional security.

RED can be staked by data providers, who supply data to RedStone's modular oracle network, and by token holders, who enhance network security through direct staking in the RedStone AVS.

RED stakers will earn rewards from RedStone data users across hundreds of blockchains, paid in widely adopted assets like ETH, BTC, SOL, and USDC.
