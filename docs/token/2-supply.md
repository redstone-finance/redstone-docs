RedStone's blockchain oracle technology has achieved product-market fit, operating on mainnet since January 2023 and attracting users with its reliable, diverse, and robust services. Now, the RedStone Distributed Data Association introduces REDâ€”designed to further decentralize the system and advance the long-term goals of the RedStone Ecosystem.
