# RED Supply

RedStone's blockchain oracle technology has achieved product-market fit, operating on mainnet since January 2023 and attracting users with its reliable, diverse, and robust services. Now, the RedStone Distributed Data Association introduces REDâ€”designed to further decentralize the system and advance the long-term goals of the RedStone Ecosystem.

At the core of RedStone is the mission to support builders with any data they need, on any chain, for any use case. As the RED Token Generation Event (TGE) approaches, we present the utility and token economics of RED below.

# RED Utility: Staking For Economic Security

For oracles to survive and secure DeFi long-term, sustainable tokenomics are essential.

RED is designed as a utility token with an innovative value accrual mechanism, introducing the first truly sustainable oracle economics.

Leveraging RedStone's EigenLayer Actively Validated Service (AVS), RED staking adds a robust layer of economic security to RedStone's oracle stack, utilizing staked RED and potentially tapping into billions of dollars staked in EigenLayer for additional security.

RED can be staked by data providers, who supply data to RedStone's modular oracle network, and by token holders, who enhance network security through direct staking in the RedStone AVS.

RED stakers will earn rewards from RedStone data users across hundreds of blockchains, paid in widely adopted assets like ETH, BTC, SOL, and USDC.

# Token Distribution

The maximum supply of RED is 1,000,000,000 (one billion) tokens, with an initial float of 30%. RED is implemented as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum Mainnet and will be available on Solana, Base, and other networks after the Token Generation Event via the Wormhole Native Token Transfer standard.

Nearly half of all RED tokens (48.3%) will be allocated to the RedStone Ecosystem & Community across the following categories: Community & Genesis, Ecosystem & Data Providers, and Protocol Development.

## RED Distribution Categories

| Category                                      | Total    |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Community & Genesis                           | 10.00%   |
| Protocol development (Partially Locked)       | 10.00%   |
| Core Contributors (Locked)                    | 20.00%   |
| Ecosystem & Data providers (Partially Locked) | 28.30%   |
| Early Backers (Locked)                        | 31.70%   |
| **Total**                                     | **100%** |

## Community & Genesis (10%)

10% of RED tokens will be distributed to the RedStone community through initial claim activities. The Community & Genesis allocation is a cornerstone of RedStone's tokenomics, recognizing the crucial role the community plays in the protocol's long-term success. These tokens will be distributed via carefully designed airdrops to reward early supporters, partners, and active participants involved in RedStone's growth. This strategy ensures fair representation for the ecosystem's earliest adopters and ongoing contributors.

## Protocol Development (10%)

10% of RED tokens are allocated to Protocol Development, ensuring RedStone's long-term sustainability and growth. This fund supports critical research and development, developer resources, and operational efficiency.

The RedStone Distributed Data Association strategically deploys these resources to drive protocol growth and advance progressive decentralization.

## Core Contributors (20%)

20% of RED tokens are allocated to Core Contributors of the RedStone Ecosystem, recognizing those who built the protocol's foundation and will continue driving its long-term growth. This allocation secures the commitment of key contributors across security, engineering, product development, community, marketing, strategy, business development, and operations.

All tokens in this category are locked and follow a strategic vesting schedule to align contributors' interests with the protocol's sustained growth and success.

## Ecosystem & Data Providers (28.3%)

28.3% of RED tokens are allocated to the Ecosystem & Data Providers category. The Ecosystem portion fuels RedStone's innovation and community growth, empowering builders, innovators, and community leaders through targeted grants and incentives. This fund supports community-driven initiatives, educational programs, and activities that drive market growth and adoption, with a focus on projects that add clear value to RedStone's expansion. It also incentivizes the adoption of new products and services until they reach critical mass.

The Data Providers allocation rewards those supplying data to RedStone's oracle infrastructure, ensuring high-quality, timely data delivery. Strategic incentives and grants encourage coverage of emerging market pairs and evolving data demands, with a reward structure that maintains top-tier data standards.

All tokens in this category follow a structured release schedule to support sustainable, long-term ecosystem growth and data provider diversity, aligned with RedStone's vision.

## Early Backers (31.7%)

31.7% of RED tokens are allocated to Early Backers, who provided vital financial, advisory, and strategic support during RedStone's development. Their industry expertise and infrastructure capabilities have been key in strengthening the protocol's foundation.

These tokens are locked and follow a strategic vesting schedule to align Early Backers' interests with RedStone's long-term success, ensuring their continued support and engagement as the protocol evolves.

# RedStone: The Modular Innovation

RedStone's modular oracle architecture makes it the most scalable, secure and performant blockchain oracle service. The design streamlines adding new assets, cutting latency, and supporting new chains, letting dApps scale freely without any constraints from the oracle provider.
