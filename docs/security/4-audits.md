# Audits

RedStone maintains a rigorous external security audit program as a cornerstone of its security assurance framework. Multiple independent security firms specializing in blockchain infrastructure conduct comprehensive audits of both core protocol components and significant system modifications prior to production deployment. The audit scope encompasses the entire infrastructure stack, including smart contracts, cryptographic attestation mechanisms, and relay networks. Critical findings undergo immediate remediation with subsequent validation, and audit reports are made publicly available below:
