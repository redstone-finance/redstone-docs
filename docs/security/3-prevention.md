# Prevention & monitoring

RedStone implements a comprehensive testing strategy that spans multiple layers of validation to ensure system integrity and security. Unit tests provide granular validation of individual components, with particular emphasis on edge cases and error handling in security-critical functions. Integration tests verify correct interaction between system components, including validation of cryptographic operations and data flow integrity. End-to-end tests simulate complete operational scenarios across the entire infrastructure stack, while specialized crash-testing systematically introduces failures at various system levels to validate graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms.

The monitoring infrastructure operates through a distributed network of specialized modules that track system health across multiple dimensions. Performance monitoring tracks latency and throughput metrics with asset-specific thresholds, while data quality monitoring validates price consistency and market depth parameters. Infrastructure monitoring tracks node health, network connectivity, and resource utilization across the distributed system components. Security monitoring specifically focuses on detecting potential attack patterns, including abnormal data submission patterns, suspicious smart contract interactions, and potential manipulation attempts. Each monitoring module maintains independent data persistence with redundant storage to ensure historical data availability for post-incident analysis.

The alert management system implements a tiered response framework with clearly defined escalation policies. Critical alerts trigger immediate notification to on-duty personnel through redundant communication channels, with automated escalation if acknowledgment is not received within configured timeframes. The 24/7 duty roster ensures continuous coverage with primary and backup personnel assigned to each shift, supported by domain specialists who can be activated for specific categories of incidents. Escalation policies define clear response timeframes and activation criteria for involving senior technical staff or management personnel. Each alert category has associated playbooks that define initial response procedures and diagnostic steps, ensuring consistent incident handling regardless of which team member responds. The system maintains a comprehensive audit trail of all alerts, responses, and resolution steps, facilitating continuous improvement of monitoring thresholds and response procedures. This entire monitoring infrastructure is implemented using redundant technology stacks with fallback services to ensure maximum reliability and system resilience.
