# FAQ

#### _What is expected of Reviewers?_

Reviewers are expected to familiarize themselves with the Credora Token Rating Framework. This familiarity can help inform Reviewer inputs, as relative views on the risk of an asset can be guided by a view that the methodology does not consider or inadequately weights a specific risk factor.

Reviewers are expected to update attestations as their view changes. For example, if an industry event drives a change in their fundamental assessment of the risk, Reviewers are expected to revise their input accordingly.

#### _Do Reviewers need to submit attestations on all ratings?_

Reviewers are not expected to submit attestations on all assets. Reviewers are only encouraged to submit attestations on assets where they have internally done adequate due diligence, and feel their submission reflects and informed view.&#x20;

#### _If internal processes do not result in a probability of default, how should I select a ratings input?_

Where Reviewers do not internally target a probability of default, it is important for them to consider the relative rating across their attestations. For example, if the reviewer is confident in the base output for certain stablecoins, they can approach attestations from a relative perspective.

#### _How are Reviewers assessed?_

Initially, Credora is tracking Reviewer inputs relative to the future consensus rating. For example, Reviewers will be more positively ranked where their inputs lead the consensus rating. This aims to incentivize accurate and timely reviews, especially as information changes.&#x20;

Over time, there are multiple ways of assessing the performance of the standardized methodology, Reviewer inputs, and the aggregate rating. Credora will introduce these methods in the [Credora Forum](https://credora-forum.discourse.group/), in advance of their implementation.&#x20;

#### _What information is revealed about Reviewer input?_

Reviewers submit and sign private, verifiable, offchain attestations to contribute to a rating. These reviews are aggregated offchain in a decentralized verifiable database (Space and Time), and published onchain using attestations.

In the aggregate onchain attestation, there is only reference the UIDs of the offchain attestation. Reviewer identities, addresses, and ratings inputs are not visible. Third parties can independently verify, via a zero knowledge proof, that the attestation process correcly utilized valid inputs.&#x20;
