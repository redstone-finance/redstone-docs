# Submitting Attestations

Credora has developed a simple interface allowing for Reviewers to submit their view on standardized ratings outputs, and their corresponding Probability of Default (PD).

The interface displays asset ratings where the Reviewer is eligible to provide input. Additionally, where reports on these assets are available, the Reviewer can access them through the interface.

When a reviewer initiates an attestation, a new page opens where they have the ability to notch the rating up and down from the standardized methodology output. Credora requests that Reviewers submit comments and rationale, allowing for iteration on the underlying methodologies.&#x20;

After selecting Generate Attestation, the Reviewer will proceed through the offchain signature process. A history of Reviewer Attestations is available on the interface.
