# Issuers

As a term, Issuers refers to the organizations who govern the issuance of a specific asset. The below table provides examples of issuers, across a range of assets. The Credora Network produces Credit Metrics on assets.

<table><thead><tr><th width="156">Asset</th><th>Type</th><th>Issuer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>cbBTC</td><td>Derivative Token - Wrapped</td><td>Coinbase Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>rETH</td><td>Derivative Token - Liquid Staking</td><td>Rocket Pool Pty Ltd</td></tr><tr><td>rsETH</td><td>Derivative Token - Liquid Restaking</td><td>Kelp DAO</td></tr><tr><td>USDC</td><td>Stablecoin - Fiat Backed</td><td>Circle Internet Financial, LLC</td></tr><tr><td>USDe</td><td>Stablecoin - Alternative</td><td>Ethena GmbH, Ethena BVI</td></tr><tr><td>WBTC</td><td>Derivative Token - Wrapped</td><td>WBTC DAO</td></tr><tr><td>wstETH</td><td>Derivative Token - Liquid Staking</td><td>Lido DAO</td></tr></tbody></table>

Absent a direct engagement with the relevant issuer, the outputs are labeled as **Indicative**. This reflects the fact that the application of the standardized methodology relies solely on publicly available information.

Asset issuers can receive a **Firm Assessment** by engaging the Credora Team via the Credora Platform. This allows issuers an opportunity to ensure the most accurate application of the Token Rating Framework. Furthermore, as approved by the relevant parties, the information provided will be included in published reports.
