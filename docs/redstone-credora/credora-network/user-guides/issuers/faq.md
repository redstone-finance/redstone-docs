# FAQ

#### _What are the benefits of a Firm Assessment?_

By engaging a Firm Assessment, asset issuers ensure a complete application of the standardized Credora methodology.

Where there is an active outstanding Indicative Assessment, asset issuers establish an ongoing relationship with the Credora Team, enforcing the use of current information.

Where there is no active outstanding Indicative Assessment, asset issuers can more quickly build user trust by demonstrating transparency and their conforming to industry standards. The existence of a Firm Assessment can help asset issuers more quickly integrate throughout the DeFi ecosystem. &#x20;

#### _How long does a Firm Assessment take?_

The Credora team will provide timeline guidance via the Credora Platform in advance of initiating the Firm Assessment process. Once initiated, Firm Assessments typically take 2 weeks, depending on the type of issuer.&#x20;

#### _Will all information privately shared with Credora be made public?_

For Indicative Assessments, Credora relies only on publicly available information. In the case of Firm Assessments, Credora will utilize private non-public information, where sufficient evidence is provided by the asset issuer. This non-public information will not be shared externally without approval from the issuer. In advance of producing rating outputs for a Firm Assessment, Credora requires sign-off from the asset issuer. In this manner, private information can impact the application of the standardized Credora methodologies, while remaining out of the public purview. Generally, the Credora team views complete transparency as the highest standard, but recognizes that in certain cases information is kept private in the context of a dynamic competitive landscape.

#### _How are Firm Assessments maintained? Does this differ from Indicative Assessments?_&#x20;

All Credora inputs into the Consensus Ratings have a specified Valid Until date. By default, this is set as 3 months. Where protocols have a Firm Assessment, Credora will update outputs as new information is made available from the issuer. For Indicative Assessments, Credora will update outputs at its discretion, and before the expiry of the Valid Until date in cases where the standardized application of the methodology is being maintained by Credora.
