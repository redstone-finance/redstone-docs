# Participants

## Credora

Credora is a participant in the network, and guides the development of standardized methodologies. These methodologies are structured approaches which assign Credit Metrics to assets and markets throughout DeFi. They are developed publicly ([Credora Forum](https://credora-forum.discourse.group/)), utilizing input from Reviewers, Contributors, and the broader community. The Credit Metrics which are outputs from the standardized methodologies are captured via attestations, ensuring traceability.&#x20;

## Reviewers

Ratings are further enhanced through Reviewer participation. Reviewers are qualified and informed market participants, who demonstrate the capability of assessing the risk of a specific set of assets. Reviewer inputs are captured via offchain attestations, ensuring verifiability while protecting the confidentiality of their input. &#x20;

## Contributors

Contributors are individuals and market participants who demonstrate the ability to contribute to methodology development and other core elements of the project. Contributors may become eligible Reviewers.&#x20;
