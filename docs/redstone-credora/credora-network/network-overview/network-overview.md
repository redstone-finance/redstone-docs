# Network Overview

Ratings play a foundational role in financial markets, enabling participants to quantify and compare risks across asset classes. In traditional finance, credit rating agencies like S\&P, Moody’s, and Fitch have built multi-billion-dollar businesses by offering independent evaluations of creditworthiness. The credit rating industry facilitates trillions of dollars in global investments.

In the evolving DeFi ecosystem, new asset classes including yield-bearing stablecoins, structured products, liquid staking protocols, and liquid restaking protocols create nuanced and opaque risks. These innovations demand scalable, standardized, and credible risk frameworks to support institutional confidence and sustainable market growth.

The Credora Network standardizes risk quantification through a decentralized network of participants, including institutional lenders, crypto-native experts, and specialized risk managers. Outputs enable the benchmarking or risk across DeFi and traditional finance. This approach lays the groundwork for a safer and more transparent DeFi ecosystem, unlocking new opportunities for capital allocation and innovation in the ecosystem.

The Credora Network provides market participants and protocols vital asset risk information. It is powered by a Consensus Rating Protocol, which enables the submission and aggregation of participant inputs.
