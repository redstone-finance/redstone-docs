# Definition and Scope of Markets

**Markets represent the fundamental unit of credit exposure, defined as a discrete loan–collateral pair.**

A market is either explicitly structured by protocol design, where a single collateral type backs borrowing of a single asset, or analytically segmented from multi-collateral systems into equivalent loan–collateral pairs for consistent risk assessment.

## Decomposing Pooled and Multi-Collateral Systems

Protocols like **Morpho** implement an isolated architecture, where each market operates as a self-contained pair with distinct collateral relationships and independent risk boundaries. 

In contrast, **Aave** and its forks (including **SparkLend**) operate as pooled lending systems. In these systems, all deposits, withdrawals, borrows, and repayments for each asset occur within a single global pool. Unlike isolated markets, these actions are interconnected—occurring in the same pool as other users’ activities—which enables efficient matching between lenders and borrowers. Similarly, **Euler** constructs interconnected Vault Networks that create comparable interdependencies.

Within these pooled systems, multiple loan-collateral relationships can exist. For analytical consistency, each position can be decomposed and grouped into virtual portfolios of loan-collateral exposures, creating a list of markets according to Credora’s definition.

To analyze these interconnected systems, the methodology constructs **"virtual markets"**—analytical constructs that aggregate all positions linking one borrowed asset to each collateral asset. For instance:

- all positions borrowing **USDC against ETH collateral** constitute one virtual market  
- while **USDC borrowed against wBTC** forms another

Although these virtual markets may not exist on-chain, they are essential for risk decomposition. Each pair captures aggregate exposure, weighted loan-to-value (LTV) distributions, and concentration risk for that specific borrow-collateral relationship.  
This decomposition transforms complex unified pools or vault networks into analyzable components while preserving the systemic interactions between them.

Furthermore, certain protocols support **multi-collateral borrowing**, where active loans can be attributed to multiple collateral assets. In these cases, positions can be decomposed into combinations of loan pairs.

Across all implementations, **markets share common structural functions**:  
they define collateralization requirements, govern interest rate mechanisms, set liquidation thresholds, and ultimately determine the credit and liquidity risk parameters of the lending portfolios they compose.

## Simulation Framework

To deliver comprehensive risk assessments across these constructs, Credora calculated the **collateral asset probability of default (PD)** and **outstanding loan risk** (for rehypothecated markets) as core inputs for **Market Simulations**, which quantify liquidation and bad debt risks.

The primary metric is the **Probability of Significant Loss (PSL)**, which measures the likelihood of a market experiencing bad debt **exceeding 1% of principal**.  
Bad debt occurs when liquidation leaves a borrower or account with residual debt but insufficient collateral to cover it.

Conceptually, simulations establish the **Anchor PSL** for a specific market, after which a set of modifiers are applied to calculate a **Final PSL** and **implied rating** per market.
