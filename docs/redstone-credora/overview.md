The Credora Network distributes ratings and risk metrics for direct consumption and for redistribution. Direct consumption is where the consumer is utilizing metrics internally, while redistribution is where the consumer is providing access to a wider audience. Ratings are utilized by for various audiences for different purposes, outlined as follows:&#x20;

| Business Type  | Consumption          | Redistribution       |
| -------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Asset Managers | :heavy\_check\_mark: |                      |
| Wallets        |                      | :heavy\_check\_mark: |
| Exchanges      | :heavy\_check\_mark: | :heavy\_check\_mark: |
| Protocols      | :heavy\_check\_mark: | :heavy\_check\_mark: |

Below are example use cases:
