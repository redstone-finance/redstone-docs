- Quantify various factors of risk with methodologies, simulations, and models.

## 7. How does the old Credora methodology compare to the new methodology?

The methodology itself remains unchanged; we’re following the same steps as before. The only modification is an update to the rating cut-off tables. We made the change because we will publish assets on the same scale, and it brought some positive differentiation in that capacity.
