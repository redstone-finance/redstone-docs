# Methodology Glossary

<table><thead><tr><th>Term</th><th>Reference</th><th width="294">Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Anchor PD</td><td>Core Methodology Concepts</td><td>Quantifies the foundational or base probability of default for a specific asset, issuer, or debt instrument. The Anchor PD is determined by analyzing primary risk characteristics using empirical evidence. An Anchor PD serves as the starting point for each Layer in the Credora Token Rating Framework. Risk factors not captured by the Anchor PD are subsequently addressed through Modifiers.</td></tr><tr><td>Credora PD Curve</td><td>Core Methodology Concepts</td><td>A standardized underlying probability of default (PD) curve that facilitates the comparison of risk across different Credora methodologies and aligns Credora ratings with credit ratings assigned by traditional rating agencies.</td></tr><tr><td>Derivative Tokens</td><td>Core Methodology Concepts</td><td>A type of digital asset that derives its value from an underlying cryptocurrency or staked asset, encompassing Wrapped Tokens, Liquid Staking Tokens, and Liquid Restaking Tokens.</td></tr><tr><td>Implied Rating</td><td>Core Methodology Concepts</td><td>A letter rating output from a risk assessment or methodology application, translating a probability of default into a corresponding rating on a standardized scale.</td></tr><tr><td>Modifier</td><td>Core Methodology Concepts</td><td>Adjusts an Anchor PD to account for additional risk variables. Applied as notch adjustments—either positive (reducing the PD) or negative (increasing the PD)—along the Credora PD Curve, modifiers evaluate specific risk characteristics using scoring curves or tables. This approach enables a more refined and precise assessment..</td></tr><tr><td>Probability of Default (PD)</td><td>Core Methodology Concepts</td><td>The likelihood that a borrower or entity will fail to meet its debt or redemption obligations within a specified time frame.</td></tr><tr><td>Stablecoins</td><td>Core Methodology Concepts</td><td>Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reference asset, such as a fiat currency.</td></tr><tr><td>Token Rating Framework</td><td>Core Methodology Concepts</td><td>A structured and multi-layered set of methodologies designed to deliver a comprehensive risk assessment for a diverse range of digital asset tokens.</td></tr><tr><td>Asset Quality Sub-Methodology</td><td>Token Rating Framework</td><td>Assesses the quality of underlying reserve assets using one of two approaches. The first is a market proxy approach that relies on public ratings, Credora assigned ratings, or comparable peer group ratings. The second approach applies credit risk measurement tools such as the Merton Model, focusing on the analysis of return volatility and the relationships between assets, equity buffers, and liabilities.</td></tr><tr><td>Calibration Layer</td><td>Token Rating Framework</td><td>A component of the Credora Token Rating Framework, this Layer applies Modifiers to the Anchor PD obtained from the Sub-Methodology Layer. These Modifiers are tailored to reflect token-specific characteristics and account for additional risk factors unique to each token category. The output of this Layer serves as the Anchor PD for the Primary Layer.</td></tr><tr><td>Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>Token Rating Framework</td><td>A component of the Sub-Methodology Layer of the Credora Token Rating Framework, this Sub-Methodology evaluates centralized custodian risk exposures including operational, regulatory, and governance risks associated with the custodian.</td></tr><tr><td>Derivative Tokens Methodology</td><td>Token Rating Framework</td><td>A comprehensive framework for assessing risk associated with derivative tokens, including wrapped tokens, liquid staking tokens, and liquid restaking tokens. </td></tr><tr><td>Layer</td><td>Token Rating Framework</td><td>Refers to a segment or stage of the Credora Token Rating Framework. Outputs from one layer serve as inputs into subsequent layers, each playing a specific role in capturing various relevant risks.</td></tr><tr><td>Primary Layer</td><td>Token Rating Framework</td><td>A component of the Credora Token Rating Framework, this Layer incorporates a set of fundamental risk measures that are relevant across all token types, and referred to as General Modifiers.</td></tr><tr><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>Token Rating Framework</td><td>A structured approach to evaluating risks associated with tokens relying on smart contract-based custody.. This Sub-Methodology operates within the Sub-Methodology Layer of the Credora Token Rating Framework.</td></tr><tr><td>Sub-Methodology Layer</td><td>Token Rating Framework</td><td>The Sub-Methodology Layer forms the foundation later of the Token Rating Framework and is divided into three key components:the Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology, Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology, and Asset Quality Sub-Methodology. </td></tr><tr><td>Adjusted Network Protocol PD</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A refined measure of the Network Protocol Probability of Default (PD), incorporating adjustments for Oracle and Bridge Risk Amplifiers as part of the Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology.</td></tr><tr><td>Audit Quality Risk Calibration Multiplier</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A Risk Calibration Multiplier within the Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology that assesses the quantity of completed audits and the presence of a robust bug bounty program. </td></tr><tr><td>Audit Quantity</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A factor in the Audit Quality Risk Calibration Multiplier, reflects the number of audits performed on a smart contract or protocol, excluding audits on the governance token.</td></tr><tr><td>Bridge</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A Risk Amplifier that assesses the risks associated with a token’s reliance on cross-chain bridges. Dependence on bridges heightens a smart contract custody reliant token’s vulnerability to security and operational risks.</td></tr><tr><td>Bug Bounty</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A factor in the Audit Quality Modifier, bug bounties are assessed based on the presence and robustness of funded bug bounty programs supported by the relevant protocol.</td></tr><tr><td>Contract Maturity</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A modifier that evaluates the operational track record of a protocol's smart contracts based on the time elapsed since their launch. Longer operating histories reflect greater scrutiny and the contracts being battle-tested under diverse conditions, demonstrating higher resilience.</td></tr><tr><td>Network Protocol PD</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>Represents the baseline probability of default for a smart contract custody protocol, derived from a comprehensive assessment of historical exploit data. This Anchor PD reflects the average risk of exploitation of smart contracts on a given network, capturing a wide spectrum of scenarios, from mature protocols with strong risk management practices to newer, unaudited, or less secure contracts.</td></tr><tr><td>Oracle Risk Amplifier</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A Risk Amplifier that evaluates whether or not a token is vulnerable to oracle risk. Tokens that rely on oracles are vulnerable to financial loss or operational disruption caused by manipulated, inaccurate, or delayed external data feeds.</td></tr><tr><td>Recent Incidents Modifier</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A modifier that adjusts the PD upward by one notch for protocols that have experienced a security incident within the past six months.</td></tr><tr><td>Risk Amplifier</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>Measures additional vulnerabilities not captured in the Anchor PD analysis of Smart Contract Sub-Methodology. Risk Amplifiers are applied by adjusting the PD upward to account for certain operational risks, such as bridge risks, oracle risks, or recent security incidents, which heighten the overall risk profile.</td></tr><tr><td>Slashing Risk</td><td>Smart Contract Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>An additive risk component part of the Smart Contract Sub-Methodology Anchor PD that accounts for potential losses from slashing events. It reflects the higher chance of collateral erosion in liquid staking and restaking protocols due to validator failures, operational complexity, or interconnected slashing incidents.</td></tr><tr><td>Business Type, Reputation, and Track Record</td><td>Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A Modifier that evaluates a custodian’s business type, reputation, and track record. Custodians are deemed more creditworthy if they demonstrate a longer operational history, a larger market share of assets under custody, and a primary business focus in traditional finance, indicating greater experience and stability.</td></tr><tr><td>Insurance</td><td>Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A Modifier that assesses the presence of insurance coverage as an indicator of enhanced risk management, where verified policies signal stronger governance, operational controls, and external validation.</td></tr><tr><td>Listed Status and Financial Transparency</td><td>Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A modifier assessing a custodian's listed status, financial transparency, and third-party audit practices. It considers the custodian's listed status, availability of audited financial statements, and adherence to robust financial reporting standards as well as conduction of third-party operational risk audits such as SOC II audits.</td></tr><tr><td>Regulatory Oversight and Licensure</td><td>Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A modifier in the Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology that evaluates the custodian’s entity type, jurisdiction, and trust and fiduciary status. Custodians subject to robust regulatory frameworks and holding fiduciary licenses are associated with lower risk.</td></tr><tr><td>Reputation</td><td>Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A Modifier that utilizes the market share of a custodian as the input. Market share is a signal of the market’s perception of security and higher market shares indicate a greater volume stakeholder and as such scrutiny over a centralised custodian practices. </td></tr><tr><td>Track Record</td><td>Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology</td><td>A Modifier that utilizes a custodian’s operational history in years as the input. Custodians with longer track records demonstrate greater reliability and proven resilience under varying conditions</td></tr><tr><td>Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRST)</td><td>Derivative Tokens Methodology</td><td>A digital asset that represents ownership claims on Liquid Staking Tokens that have been re-staked on separate protocols to enhance yields due increased risk of interconnected slashing incidents.</td></tr><tr><td>Liquid Staking Tokens (LST)</td><td>Derivative Tokens Methodology</td><td>Digital assets locked within a blockchain network to support operations such as transaction validation, while earning staking rewards. These tokens maintain liquidity by allowing users to trade or utilize them without unlocking the underlying staked assets.</td></tr><tr><td>Wrapped Tokens (WT)</td><td>Derivative Tokens Methodology</td><td>Tokenized representations of assets from another blockchain, maintaining a 1:1 peg to their underlying value. These tokens enable cross-chain interoperability, allowing the asset’s functionality to extend across various blockchain ecosystems and protocols.</td></tr><tr><td>Legal Claims</td><td>Stablecoin Methodology</td><td>A Modifier that evaluates (i) whether the tokenholder's legal claim is explicitly addressed in the Terms of Service and (ii) if tokenholders have direct claims on underlying reserves or equivalent asset rights. Tokens with clear documentation providing tokenholder claims on reserves reduce risk to investors/tokenholders.</td></tr><tr><td>Regulatory Cover</td><td>Stablecoin Methodology</td><td>A Modifier that assesses the type and existence of licensure that the Stablecoin protocol operates under as an input. It measures the extent of regulatory protections and frameworks applicable to an entity, including its compliance with relevant laws. Stronger licensing and compliance reduce regulatory risk, while weaker or absent licenses increase it.</td></tr><tr><td>Reserve Management Operations</td><td>Stablecoin Methodology</td><td>A Modifier that assesses if asset managers responsible for the majority of reserve management have greater than 2 years of a track record in relevant strategies. More experienced teams are a positive signal for a stablecoin protocol's risk management practices. </td></tr><tr><td>Asset Transparency</td><td>Primary Layer</td><td>A modifier that assesses the clarity and reliability of reserve disclosures regarding the reserves backing a derivative or stablecoin token. Transparency types include (i) On-Chain, (ii) Proof of Reserves with Third-Party Audit, (iii) Proof of Reserves without Audit, and (iv) No Traceability. Higher levels of transparency bolster market confidence and reduce perceived risk.</td></tr><tr><td>Collateralization</td><td>Primary Layer</td><td>A Modifier that calculates the ratio between a token’s reserves and its liabilities (i.e. outstanding tokens issued). Greater collateralization signals enhanced financial stability and lower risk. </td></tr><tr><td>Dependencies</td><td>Primary Layer</td><td>An additive adjustment to the output following the application of the Primary Layer modifiers, accounting for the additional risk introduced by underlying assets that are not in-kind. The adjustment is calculated by determining the average PD of the non-in-kind assets and then modeling the combined PD using the union of occurrence probabilities.</td></tr><tr><td>General Token Modifier</td><td>Primary Layer</td><td>A series of Modifiers that refine the Anchor PD, which is the final output obtained from the Calibration Layer. These modifiers account for token-agnostic risks inherent in derivative token and stablecoin structures. By addressing risks uniformly present across all such tokens, they enable the measurement of risk and facilitate the relative ranking of final outputs.</td></tr><tr><td>Governance</td><td>Primary Layer</td><td>A Modifier that evaluates a smart contract’s upgrade controls and distribution of voting power as inputs. Upgradeable contracts with decentralized governance and control systems requiring high thresholds for implementation of upgrades reduce risk and enhance smart contract security.</td></tr><tr><td>Market Capitalization</td><td>Primary Layer</td><td>A Modifier that evaluates market capitalization in relation to the average market capitalization of its peer group. Market capitalization is a signal of the market’s confidence in the token. </td></tr><tr><td>Peg Track Record</td><td>Primary Layer</td><td>A Modifier that assesses the stability of the value of a token to the value of the underlying collateral backing it. In the case of stablecoins, it evaluates the peg stability over the value the stablecoin claims to maintain, over a defined historical period. Tokens with more stable pegs to underlying assets  are considered lower risk, as they provide greater confidence to investors and signal enhanced ecosystem adoption.  </td></tr><tr><td>Redeemability</td><td>Primary Layer</td><td>A Modifier that assesses duration risk from when a tokenholder redeems their tokens from the treasury to when the underlying assets are returned. Shorter duration risk indicates higher creditworthiness, as it reflects the treasury's ability to meet redemptions efficiently, reducing the likelihood of liquidity or operational delays.</td></tr><tr><td>Total Value Locked (TVL)</td><td>Primary Layer</td><td>A Modifier that utilizes a protocol’s TVL in relation to the average TVL of its peer group tokens. TVL reflects the market’s level of confidence in the token, with higher TVL often signaling increased scrutiny and broader adoption.</td></tr></tbody></table>
