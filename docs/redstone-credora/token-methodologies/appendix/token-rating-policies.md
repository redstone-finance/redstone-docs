# Token Rating Policies

Policies cover the processes related to applying the Credora Token Rating Framework. These policies are relevant for token issuers or stakeholders, and consumers of Credora Network outputs.

## Types of Token Ratings

Credora provides two types of Token Ratings: **Firm** and **Indicative**, based on the degree of connectivity to the issuer and information availability. Token Ratings may change from Indicative to Firm after Onboarding Requirements are met.

- **Firm:** The token issuer has an account on the Credora platform, and has completed Onboarding Requirements.&#x20;
- **Indicative:** The token issuer does not have an account on the Credora platform, and has not completed Onboarding Requirements. In these cases, Credora gathers sufficient public information to conduct the process independently.

#### **Rating Steps**

For Firm Ratings, the process follows the below steps:

1. **Onboarding**: Issuers complete Onboarding Requirements.
2. **Fit Evaluation**: Credora determines eligibility, considering the quality of information available. Credora only provides ratings where equipped to produce reliable results.
3. **Payment:** After payment is received, Credora initiates the review of available information.&#x20;
4. **Preliminary Rating**: Credora conducts a preliminary review, leading to a Preliminary Rating and/or follow-up questions. Preliminary Ratings are private.&#x20;
5. **Submission of Additional Information**: Issuers provide additional data and clarification as required.
6. **Final Rating**: A final rating is assigned based on the information provided.
7. **Publish Results**: The final rating and associated metrics are published via the Credora platform, and reports are prepared.

#### **Timeline**

Credora provides guidance on the timeline after the completion of Credora Onboarding Requirements and the Fit Evaluation.&#x20;

Once the issuer is in a ready state, the process typically takes 3 weeks. Delays can occur if issuers are slow to provide requested information. Where this is the case, the rating may be deprioritized relative to the issuer backlog. Credora will inform the issuer of any timeline changes at least one week in advance.

#### **Credit Metrics & Reports**

As part of the Token Rating, Credora generates **Credit Metrics** and accompanying reports, which include:

- **Probability of Default (PD)**: Credora methodologies rely on a probability of default curve. This curve is derived from historic realized defaults across major ratings agencies. Credora methodologies begin by calculating an Anchor PD, and subsequently apply modifiers which result in shifts along the underlying probability of default curve.
- **Implied Rating**: A letter rating which serves as a comparison between Credora methodology outputs and outputs produced by a major ratings agency, based on historically realized probabilities of default per letter rating.&#x20;
- **Risk Score**: A numerical output derived from the Implied Rating.

Credora also produces reports, outlining the application of the methodology and other information on the issuer.

#### **Fees**

For Firm Ratings, Credora requires payment before beginning work on the Preliminary Rating.

#### **Maintenance**

Credit Metrics and Credit Reports are accompanied by a Publish Date and Valid Until Date, defined as follows:&#x20;

- **Publish Date**: The date on which the Token Rating was completed.&#x20;
- **Valid Until Date**: The date through which the Token Rating is considered valid. By default, the Valid Until date is set as 3 months after the Publish Date.

#### **Token Rating Consistency**

Credora follows a rules-based process. This ensures the consistent application of any specific methodology.&#x20;

Where there is a circumstance which justifies deviation from the underlying processes and policies outlined in Credora documentation, Credora will update the communicated timeline and implement an appropriate update to the processes or policies in advance of completing the Token Rating.

Where there are outstanding Credit Metrics which are impacted by the policy change, unless the policy change results in a Significant Deviation (rating change of 2 or more notches) , Credora applies changes on a rolling basis as the respective Valid Until date expires.&#x20;
