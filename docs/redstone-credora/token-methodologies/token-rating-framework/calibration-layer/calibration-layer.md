# Calibration Layer

The Calibration Layer is a component of the Credora Token Rating Framework where Modifiers are applied to the Anchor PD obtained from the Sub-Methodology Layer. The set of Modifiers is tailored to token-specific characteristics, accounting for additional risk factors unique to each token category. The output of this Layer serves as the Anchor PD for the Primary Layer.

The [Derivative Tokens Methodology](derivative-tokens-methodology.md) and [Stablecoin Methodology](stablecoin-methodology.md) are Calibration Layer methodologies.&#x20;
