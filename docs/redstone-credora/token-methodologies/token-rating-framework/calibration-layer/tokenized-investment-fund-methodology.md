# Tokenized Investment Fund Methodology

The Credora Tokenized Investment Funds Methodology is a comprehensive framework designed to assess credit risks associated with tokenized investment funds. The methodology assesses the risk of credit events or operational failures driving losses to the fund's net asset value (NAV). These tokenized investment funds include traditional investment fund characteristics such as bankruptcy-remoteness and legal segregation of assets. See further details in the default definition section.&#x20;

The types of assets subject to the scope of this methodology include:

- **Tokenized Money Market Funds:** Invest in short-duration, high-quality instruments such as Treasury bills or repurchase agreements, typically held in custody by a regulated financial institution. These funds aim to provide stable yield and daily liquidity.
- **Tokenized Fixed-Income Investment Funds:** Invest in a range of fixed-income securities, including government and corporate bonds, with varying levels of duration and credit quality. These Funds aim to offer enhanced yield relative to money market funds.
- **Other Yield-Bearing Tokenized Funds:** Include tokenized funds that deploy investor capital in structured, yield-generating strategies. These may include trading strategies that generate predictable cash flows. The value and performance of these tokens are directly tied to the underlying yield of the deployed capital.

## Methodology Overview

The Anchor PD is established by evaluating Asset Quality and Custody Risk through two independent sub-methodologies. Asset Quality assesses the risk profile of the tokenized investment Fund's portfolio composition, while Custody Risk evaluates risks associated with the custody of investments.

Custody Risk is determined based on the custodian's creditworthiness. In cases where the custodian has public ratings, those are used as a proxy. If no public ratings are available, Custody Risk is assessed using the [Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology](../sub-methodologies/centralized-custody-sub-methodology.md).

In addition to Custody Risk, the credit profile of underlying reserves are evaluated using the [Asset Quality Sub-Methodology](../sub-methodologies/asset-quality-sub-methodology.md). For example in the case of tokenized money market funds, the sub-methodology assesses US Treasury Bills or similar financial assets using the credit rating of the respective entity or proxy rating of similar funds.&#x20;

Furthermore, as part of the analysis, portfolio duration risk is assessed to inform the PD generated by the Asset Quality Sub-Methodology based on the weighted average duration of the investment fund's portfolio.&#x20;

The Anchor PD is calculated by combining the Custody and Asset Quality Risk factors. It serves as an input for the Calibration Layer methodology, which evaluates additional risks. For Tokenized Investment Funds, the application of the Calibration Layer results in a final PD and implied rating. As opposed to other Methodologies under Credora'a [Token Rating Framework](https://credora.gitbook.io/credora-network-documentation/SZXScuQdZiFKlGcITrLr/token-methodologies/token-rating-framework), there is no application of General Token Modifiers. These are removed as the majority do not apply. For instance, there is no collateralization as funds are direct investment, secondary market trading is typically limited in favor of direct redemption mechanisms.

### Custody Risk

The Custody Risk section in the Tokenized Investment Funds Methodology evaluates the risk associated with the custody of investment Fund assets. In cases where there are public ratings of the custodian, the PD is assigned in line with the public rating. Where there is no public rating of the custodian, the PD is calculated via the Centralized Custodian Sub-Methodology.

The analysis begins with the determination of the Anchor PD, which serves as the baseline measure of risk, and applies a series of modifiers that adjust the PD and implied rating based on specific factors. The final outcome reflects risk exposures of the custodian pertaining to operational, regulatory, governance risks, as well as risks inherent to the business of digital asset custody. The methodology is informed by historical default events with respect to digital asset custodians and calibrated via an empirical analysis of these default events to ensure adequate capturing of key risks related to digital asset custody business. Please see [Centralized Custody Sub-Methodology](../sub-methodologies/centralized-custody-sub-methodology.md) for additional information.

As tokenized investment funds are bankruptcy-remote structures, a 3 notch adjustment is applied in the custody section, accounting for structural protections. It is only applied when legal documentation confirms these protections.

### Asset Quality

The Asset Quality Sub-Methodology evaluates the risk of the underlying assets and investment strategy. Since tokenized fund providers employ different mechanisms to structure and support their strategies, the assessment is tailored to the specific type of strategy used and asset exposures.&#x20;

Please see [Asset Quality Sub-Methodology](../sub-methodologies/asset-quality-sub-methodology.md) for additional information regarding methods utilized to determine the PD stemming from exposures to certain asset types or strategies.

### Anchor PD Conclusion

Once Asset Quality and Custody Risk are independently evaluated, Credora calculates the Anchor PD using the following formula:

Anchor PD = PD Asset Quality + PD Custody Risk - (PD Asset Quality \* PD Custody Risk)

## Calibration Layer

The Calibration Layer refines the Anchor Probability of Default (PD) by incorporating Tokenized Investment Fund Modifiers that address residual risks not captured in the Asset Quality or Custody assessments. These modifiers account for general factors applicable across asset types and specific tokenized fund characteristics.

The application of these modifiers results in an assessment that reflects the complete credit profile. The final output of this layer is the final PD, corresponding implied rating and risk score.

### Tokenized Investment Fund Modifiers

For tokenized investment Funds, the modifiers set includes an analysis of Regulatory Oversight, Fund Transparency, Management Experience, Assets Under Management, Smart Contract Risk, and Redemption.

#### Regulatory Oversight

The Regulatory Oversight Modifier evaluates the regulatory and legal environment of the jurisdiction where an investment fund is offered. It considers the highest regulatory oversight index score among the tokenized investment fund's operating jurisdictions. This modifier measures the risk associated with regulatory uncertainty, policy shifts, weak legal protections, and the overall robustness of enforcement mechanisms. Jurisdictions with strong, stable, and well-enforced regulatory frameworks reduce operational risk and uncertainty, while weak regulatory oversight significantly elevates risks related to compliance and potential disruptions in operations.

The input to the Regulatory Oversight Modifier is the primary country from which the tokenized investment Fund is offered. The Regulatory Oversight Index is used to determine the country's relative ranking, drawing on data from the Basel Anti-Money Laundering Index and the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index. These indicators help quantify the strength and effectiveness of the jurisdiction's regulatory and legal environment.

The notch adjustments are based on the regulatory jurisdiction, where each country's rank is mapped to a particular rating tier. The table below demonstrates the various tiers along with the resulting notch adjustment.

| Tier   | Country Ranks | Notch Adjustment |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Tier 1 | 1-25          | 0.0              |
| Tier 2 | 26+           | -0.5             |

#### Fund Transparency

The Fund Transparency Modifier assesses the level of financial disclosure, auditing practices, and third-party oversight for a tokenized investment fund. Lower transparency increases risks of inaccurate valuations, misrepresentation, operational mismanagement, or fraud, potentially leading to significant financial losses or reputational damage. High transparency, combined with robust independent oversight, reduces these risks significantly. The notch adjustments are determined based on the presence of audits by reputable firms, the existence of independent fund administrators, and the consistency and regularity of fund performance reporting.

| Third Party Auditor | Notch Adjustments |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Yes                 | 0.0               |
| No                  | -0.5              |

| Fund Administrator | Notch Adjustments |
| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Yes                | 0.0               |
| No                 | -0.5              |

| Financial Reporting Frequency | Notch Adjustments |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Daily / Real Time             | 0.0               |
| Weekly                        | -0.1              |
| Monthly                       | -0.25             |
| Quarterly                     | -0.5              |
| > Quarterly                   | -1.0              |

The Financial Transparency modifier output is the sum of the three factors listed above.&#x20;

#### Management Experience

The Management Experience Modifier assesses the track record of the asset management team and the operational expertise of the tokenization partner. It considers the length and relevance of the asset management team's experience with similar reserves management related investment strategies, recognizing that more experienced teams are more likely to make informed decisions, manage risks effectively, and adapt to evolving regulatory and market conditions. This modifier also evaluates the fund tokenization team's experience operating tokenized financial products, as teams with extensive expertise are better positioned to handle the unique technological, regulatory, and operational challenges inherent to tokenized funds.

| Asset Management Track Record | Notch Adjustments |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| < 5 Years                     | -0.5              |
| 5 - 20 Years                  | -0.25             |
| > 20 Years                    | 0.0               |

| Tokenized Funds Track Record | Notch Adjustments |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| < 2 Year                     | -0.5              |
| 2 - 5 Years                  | -0.25             |
| > 5 Years                    | 0.0               |

The Management Experience modifier output is the sum of the factors listed above.&#x20;

#### Assets Under Management (AUM)

The AUM Modifier evaluates the total assets under management (AUM) of a tokenized investment fund relative to comparable products in the market. AUM serves as a proxy for fund scale, adoption, operational capacity, investor trust and liquidity. Higher AUM generally reflects greater investor confidence, broader market acceptance, and enhanced operational resources. Additionally, larger AUM often leads to improved liquidity. Further, funds with higher AUM tend to attract increased scrutiny from market participants, reinforcing discipline, transparency and a greater smart contract security scrutiny.

Tokenized funds with AUM above a certain threshold relative to their peers do not receive a negative adjustment, while those with significantly lower AUM are subject to downward adjustments. To determine this, a list of all tokenized investment funds is compiled and ranked based on their latest reported AUM. Only funds with AUM of $25 million or more are included in the comparison set. Each fund's AUM is then measured against the median AUM of this peer group, and the result is used as the input for the AUM Modifier, which is applied along a defined scoring curve.

A notch adjustment is determined based on the AUM Modifier according to the following table:

| AUM Modifier (Min) | AUM Modifier (Max) | Notch Adjustments |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1.5                | 1.5+               | 0.0               |
| 0.5                | 1.5                | -0.1              |
| 0.0                | 0.5                | -0.25             |

#### Smart Contract Risk

The Smart Contract Risk Modifier evaluates risks associated with the underlying smart contracts, focusing on two core factors: Audit Quantity and Contract Maturity. Compared to other methodologies, smart contract risks are reduced due to the use of simple contract structures for issuance. As a result, the maximum number of smart contract audits observed is currently four, with the vast majority of funds undergoing only a single audit—significantly fewer than the typical standards seen in DeFi applications. The outputs of these factors are further adjusted using multiplier modifiers based on the presence of an offchain registry and whether the contract is permissioned.

##### Audit Quantity

The presence of smart contract audits reduces the probability of smart contract exploits. The Audit Quality component of the Smart Contract Risk Modifier incorporates analysis of the quantity of smart contract audits.&#x20;

Audit Quantity is defined as the number of independent audits conducted on the smart contract underpinning the tokenized investment Fund. More audits indicate stronger scrutiny and a higher likelihood that critical vulnerabilities have been identified and resolved. The number of audits is then mapped to a notch adjustment as per the below table.

| Audity Quantity | Notch Adjustment |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| 0               | -4.00            |
| 1               | -0.40            |
| 2               | -0.20            |
| 3+              | 0.00             |

##### Contract Maturity

Next, the methodology considers Contract Maturity. The Contract Maturity modifier adjusts a token's risk profile based on the length of time its underlying smart contract has been operational. Longer-established contracts with more proven track records receive positive notch adjustments, reflecting greater confidence in their stability. Newer contracts with limited operational history receive negative notch adjustments, reflecting increased uncertainty and higher perceived risk. The maturity is tiered and mapped to a notch adjustment as below.

| Maturity (Min) | Maturity (Max) | Notch Adjustment |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 0              | 6              | -0.5             |
| 6              | 12             | -0.4             |
| 12             | 18             | -0.25            |
| 18             | 24             | -0.15            |
| 24+            | –              | 0.0              |

The Audit Quantity and Contract Maturity notch adjustment are then added to calculate the total smart contract risk modifier magnitude. The following multipliers are utilized to further calibrate the final smart contract risk modifier adjustment.

##### Offchain Registry and Permissioned Contracts

Offchain registries—typically maintained by a regulated transfer agent—act as a secondary source of record-keeping. This "double ledger" approach reduces the impact of potential smart contract exploits by ensuring that ultimate asset ownership and eligibility are validated offchain.&#x20;

Permissioned smart contracts further reduce exposure by restricting function access to pre-approved entities, thereby minimizing the attack surface and mitigating the likelihood of logic manipulation or exploit attempts commonly associated with fully permissionless DeFi protocols.

The modifiers above are discounted by 50% in cases where there is an offchain registry and the smart contracts for asset eligibility is permissioned.&#x20;

Credora has not observed instances of tokenized investment funds being issued without the presence of an offchain registry and permissioned smart contract infrastructure. However, we recognize that this may become applicable in the future under certain jurisdictions. In such instances, the methodology is currently designed to amplify smart contract risk by applying a 2x multiplier to the outputs of the Audit Quantity and Contract Maturity modifiers.

#### Redemption

The Redemption Modifier evaluates the risk associated with the time it takes for investors to redeem or withdraw funds from a tokenized investment fund. Redemption risk reflects the liquidity and operational responsiveness of the fund structure. Shorter redemption periods reduce liquidity risk, enable more agile investor exits, and limit exposure to adverse market movements during the withdrawal process. Conversely, longer redemption timelines can increase the risk of delays, asset value deterioration, or fund mismanagement during the redemption window.

This modifier measures the maximum time frame within which redemptions are processed under normal operating conditions, based on the fund's legal documentation, disclosures, or historical practices.

Redemption periods with an instant settlement feature, such as that offered by BUIDL, are treated as the lowest risk with no notch adjustment applied. On the other hand, longer redemption timelines receive increasingly negative notch adjustments based on the duration.

| Redemption Timeframe | Notch Adjustment |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| T+0 / Instant        | 0.0              |
| T+0 to T+1           | -0.1             |
| T+1 to T+3           | -0.15            |
| T+3 to T+7           | -0.25            |
| > 7 days             | -0.5             |

Funds that do not provide clear redemption timelines are assigned the most conservative adjustment.
