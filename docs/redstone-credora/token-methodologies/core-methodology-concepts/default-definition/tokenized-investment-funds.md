# Tokenized Investment Funds

For Tokenized Investment Funds, the **Reserve Insolvency** component of the default definition is modified versus tokens with fixed redemption mechanics. Tokenized Investment Funds are redeemable for a share of net asset value (NAV). As a result, although the asset value itself may be stable (i.e. tokenized money market funds), there is no promise of a specific redemption price.

For Tokenized Investment Funds, in place of the standard Reserve Insolvency definition, Credora methodologies measure the probability of a 1% NAV losses arising from underlying investment credit events or operational failures.

Credit events occur when there is a deterioration in the quality of the underlying assets held by the fund. This includes borrower defaults or missed interest payments. Such events reduce the value of the assets backing the fund and can meaningfully impact the NAV.

Operational failures refer to breakdowns in the systems, processes, or infrastructure responsible for managing the fund. Examples include smart contract bugs or custodial mismanagement. These failures can lead to unexpected losses.
