# Historic Incidents

The below historic incidents aim to provide additional clarity on default classification according to Credora definitions. The examples capture events across a variety of token types.&#x20;

### USDT - April 2017 - Loss of Banking Partners

- On April 22nd, Tether [announced](https://tether.io/news/announcement/) Taiwanese banking partner issues, including the blockage of incoming wire transfers. In the following period, USDT traded as low as $0.91 on April 26th. Tether searched for alternative banking partners, and communicated the expectation that outstanding supply was unlikely to increase.
- On May 19th, USDT again traded at $1.00. During the period, Tether was able to utilize alternate methods for processing creations and redemptions. Additionally, Tether pursued new banking relationships.

According to Credora definitions, this classifies as a Stress Event. While USDT reserve backing may have remained adequate (transparency was limited at the time), the issue stemmed from loss of Tether's ability to accept fiat deposits, driving concerns regarding the stability of banking relationships. Although redemptions may have been challenging during the period for select customers, there is no evidence of a sustained disruption to redemptions. These challenges ultimately drove changes in Tether’s creation and redemption mechanics, where [minimums](https://tether.io/news/tether-update/) were introduced.&#x20;

_If Tether was unable to process redemptions for a 2-week period, this would have been classified as a Redemption Failure. Although transparency is improved, Tether reserve adequacy has historically been heavily scrutinized._&#x20;

### WBTC - November 2022 - Systemic Concerns

- On November 9th, the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research, a WBTC merchant, triggered market-wide panic. Alameda's role in minting over 100,000 WBTC drove reserve risk concerns.
- On November 10th, WBTC price deviated from BTC, the ratio trading as low as 0.9875 amid growing uncertainty. The discount deepened in the following weeks, trading as low as 0.9774 on November 25th. The price recovered by November 30, as the market regained confidence in WBTC backing.&#x20;

According to Credora definitions, this would be classified as a Stress Event. While WBTC traded below BTC, the WBTC transparency page indicated adequate reserves. Although there were discussions regarding slow redemption processing, there was never a sustained disruption for a 2-week period.

### USDC - March 2023 - Bank Failure

- On March 10th, during the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Circle disclosed that [$3.3 billion](https://x.com/circle/status/1634391505988206592?s=20) of its \~$40 billion reserves remained at SVB.&#x20;
- USDC traded as low as [$0.8774](https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdc-depegs-as-circle-confirms-3-3b-stuck-with-silicon-valley-bank?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Despite the depegging, Circle continued to process redemptions, redeeming a net of [$1.4 billion](https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdc-depegs-as-circle-confirms-3-3b-stuck-with-silicon-valley-bank?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in an 8-hour period.&#x20;
- On March 12th, US regulators announced that all [SVB depositors](https://www.circle.com/pressroom/3-3-billion-of-usdc-reserve-risk-removed-dollar-de-peg-closes?utm_source=chatgpt.com) would be made whole.

According to Credora definitions, the USDC incident is classified as a Stress Event. There was neither a 1-week period of Reserve Insolvency, or a 2-week Redemption Failure.

_If there was a different outcome for SVB depositors, a Reserve Insolvency default event may have occurred._&#x20;

### Euler - March 2023 - Flash Loan Exploit

Credora methodologies apply to DeFi protocol receipt tokens. For example, Pendle principal tokens. As a result, historic DeFi protocol exploits are relevant for better understanding the application of default definitions.&#x20;

- On March 13th, Euler Finance experienced a [flash loan attack](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/euler-finance-flash-loan-attack/), resulting in \~$200m loss. Hackers stole funds in USDC, WBTC, stETH, and DAI.
- The Euler protocol issued eTokens (representing collateral) and dTokens (representing debt). As the attack resulted in the draining of collateral assets from the protocol.
- On April 6th, the hacker returned stolen funds.

According to Credora definitions, this incident classifies as a default. Outstanding eTokens experienced Reserve Insolvency for multiple weeks and Redemption Failure for the same period. This example is included as increasingly, comparable receipt tokens are utilized as collateral throughout DeFi.

### USD0++ - January 2025 - Redemption Mechanics Change

- On January 9, USD0++, a derivative token of the USD0 stablecoin, experienced a devaluation event, falling as low as $0.89 and stabilizing near $0.92. This event was precipitated by Usual Protocol's introduction of [new redemption mechanisms](https://usual.money/blog/usual-s-next-leap-solidifying-a-4-year-horizon-for-sustainable-growth), which replaced the prior 1:1 USD0 redemption model.&#x20;
- The change was unexpected by the market, leading to liquidations and liquidity shifts. In parallel, the protocol announced a forthcoming "1:1 Early Unstaking" feature to address concerns, enabling users to [redeem USD0++](https://usual.money/blog/usd0-upgrade-early-unstaking-vaults-liquidity)for USD0 by forfeiting accrued rewards.
- The sudden re-pricing was reflective of a communication or operational shortcoming, in that the change caught a considerable amount of stakeholders by surprise.&#x20;

Inherently, there was no meaningful change in the reserves backing USD0++ and therefore no 1-week period of Reserve Insolvency. In certain communications, the Usual team did disclose the temporary nature of the 1:1 USD0 redemption facility. Although the mechanics changed, there was not a 2-week period of Redemption Impairment.
