# Methodology Development

By publicizing and openly developing methodologies, Credora aims to foster industry collaboration and elevate market standards. **Input on the methodologies is encouraged in the** [**Credora Forum**](https://credora-forum.discourse.group/).

Credora plays a role in guiding the development of the methodologies. In addition to the Forum, Credora also captures input directly from Reviewers on the submission of attestations. In this role, Credora is committed to upholding the following best practices:

- Aim to establish consensus on methodology changes, considering a diverse range of views.
- Present analysis and evidence as required for community consideration.
- Where methodology considerations are raised away from the forum, provide summaries of the discussions for community consideration.
- Guide the community towards measuring and prioritizing improvement in the performance of the outputs.

This documentation includes an overview of [Core Methodology Concepts](core-methodology-concepts/), and the initial version of the [Token Rating Framework](token-rating-framework/). The Token Rating Framework is a collection of intertwined methodologies. This structure ensures common elements are uniformly analyzed across tokens, while also enabling the comparison of key risk drivers.&#x20;
