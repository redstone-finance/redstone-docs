# MEP

This section covers **Methodology Enhancement Proposals** (MEP), currently under consideration by the Credora team and Credora Network community. Unless noted as implemented, these frameworks are not utilized in existing outputs produced by Credora.

If you are interested in providing input on MEPs, please visit the Credora Forum. After the relevant comment and discussion period, if the respective MEP is included in the Token Rating Framework, Credora will update documentation and outputs accordingly.&#x20;
