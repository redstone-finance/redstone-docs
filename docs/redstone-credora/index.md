RedStone's recent acquisition of Credora marks a significant milestone in its mission to provide enhanced transparency and security in the crypto space. Credora is known for its cutting-edge DeFi risk ratings that assess the risk profiles of tokens and vaults. These ratings enable risk-adjusted return calculations, which allow users to make better decisions about holding assets, yield farming, lending, and engaging in other DeFi activities.

## Benefits

- Risk transparency and enhanced ecosystem trust  
- Informed risk-reward decision making  
- Elevated DeFi market standards  
- Early warnings on changing risk profiles  
- Risk/Reward adjusted strategies  

## Use Cases

- [Higher growth potential](https://x.com/CredoraNetwork/status/1929887651684839822) as rated vaults and strategies grow faster than unrated ones  
- DeFi risk ratings which are the crypto-native version of TradFi risk ratings (Moody’s, S&P), enabling more capital and institutions to enter DeFi  
- Dynamic risk management, portfolio construction, and active optimization for yield strategies  
- Data-driven decision making to earn the highest risk-adjusted yields  

Credora's risk ratings will initially launch on [Morpho and Spark](https://x.com/CredoraNetwork/status/1986449614892130541). Over time, coverage will expand to new assets, protocols, additional vaults, and yield aggregators.

Credora's mission is to help users avoid the next Terra, Stream, Elixir, etc. DeFi offers great products and risk-adjusted yields, and Credora exists to help users find them.
