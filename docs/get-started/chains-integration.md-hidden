# ⛓ Chains integration

## EVM-compatible chains

RedStone Oracles can be integrated with EVM-compatible chains out of the box thanks to the [evm-connector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@redstone-finance/evm-connector). Examples of the chains tested by our team can be found [here](https://showroom.redstone.finance/).

If you want to test your chain there is an example contract and script [here](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-showroom/tree/main/example). You need to follow two steps:

1. Deploy integration example contract to your chain
2. Fill in missing parameters and run an example Typescript script that does the following things:

- fetches data from the decentralized cache layer,
- adds signed price data to transaction data,
- interacts with the contract and receives price data.

You should be able to see price data logged to the console.

## Non EVM-compatible chains

Currently, we support mainly EVM-compatible chains. Our team developed an [evm-connector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@redstone-finance/evm-connector) that makes RedStone Oracles integrated with them out of the box.

But we also support some non-EVM-compatible chains:

- [TRON](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-tron-integration)
- [Stacks](https://stacks.org/redstone)
- [Near](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-near-connectors)

Feel free to contact us [on discord](https://redstone.finance/discord) if you would like to implement a connector to any other non-EVM-compatible chain. We'll be happy to assist you.
